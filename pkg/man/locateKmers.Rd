\alias{locateKmers}
\title{Locate occurrences of specified k-mers}
\usage{
locateKmers(kmers, seqs, directional = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{kmers}{character vector of k-mers to search for}

\item{seqs}{named character vector of sequences in which to locate
kmer}

\item{directional}{logical value: if FALSE, counts occurrences of
either kmers or their reverse-complements. Makes sense only if
applying to DNA sequences!}
}
\value{
data.frame with three columns: `seqid' containing the name
    of the sequence from seqs in which the k-mer was found; `kmer'
    indicating the k-mer located; and `location' giving the 1-based
    position at which the match was found.
}
\description{
Find locations of matches of vector of k-mers in each element of a
named character vector.
}
\examples{
kmerLoci <- locateKmers(c('AAAAA', 'CATACTGAGA'), simulatedSeqs)

}
