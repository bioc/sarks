Description: Suffix Array Kernel Smoothing (see
    https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/35/20/3944/5418797),
    or SArKS, identifies sequence motifs whose presence correlates
    with numeric scores (e.g., differential expression statistics)
    assigned to the sequences (e.g., putative promoter
    sequences). SArKS uses nonparametric kernel smoothing over
    sequence similarity as quantified by location within a suffix
    array based on the full set of input sequences. A second round of
    smoothing over spatial proximity reveals multi-motif domains
    (MMDs). Discovered motifs can then be merged or extended based on
    adjacency within MMDs. False positive rates are estimated and
    controlled by permutation testing.
